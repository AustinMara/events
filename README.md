### @explicitHints true
In this lesson we are learning about **events**!

Codey what are events?

ðŸ¤–: Events are what you use to make things happen.

```template
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
	
})
scene.setBackgroundColor(15)
effects.starField.startScreenEffect()
let codey = sprites.create(assets.image`codey`, SpriteKind.Player)

```

## Button Events

If you look to the right you'll see Codey floating peacefully in space. Let's ruin his moment!

We can see an empty ``||variables(controller):on [A] button [pressed] ||`` container in the workspace. <br>

Let's see what happens when we add a ``||scene: camera shake by [4] pixels for [500] ms ||`` to the container. 

~hint What is a container?

---

ðŸ¤–: A container is something you put stuff in! <br> 
For example: last night I put my leftover Codey's Classic Oil and Metal Shaving Tacos&copy; in a container so I could have leftovers today! <br>
A code container is the same thing but less delicious!
